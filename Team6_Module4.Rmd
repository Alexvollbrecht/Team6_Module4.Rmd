## Introduction

The central theme of this project is to assess the morphological and allometric differences between ecomorphs in the genus *Anolis*. These ecomorphs represent species with similar ecological niches, but which may not share a recent common ancestor. By analyzing the variation in limb length and body size across these ecomorphs, we can explore the role of evolution in shaping their physical adaptations (Hagey et al. 2017).

## Methods

To evaluate morphological differences, we performed phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) analyses. The data include snout-vent length (SVL) and hindlimb total length (HTotal) across different Anolis ecomorphs. Models were built under both Brownian motion (BM) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) modes of character evolution. We also log-transformed the data and corrected for phylogenetic relationships using a published phylogenetic tree (Revell 2012).

## Results

The models indicated significant differences in limb length among the different ecomorphs, particularly in the relationship between SVL and HTotal. Phylogenetically corrected residuals show consistent patterns across ecomorph groups.

## Discussion

Our results suggest that evolutionary pressures have influenced limb length differently across ecomorphs. This finding aligns with previous research that indicates ecological specialization plays a crucial role in morphological adaptation.
